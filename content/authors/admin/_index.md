I am currently a fifth-year PhD candidate at Carnegie Mellon University, actively pursuing opportunities as a Research Scientist, Applied Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Scientist, and am available to commence work as early as September 2023.

My research interests center on the application of machine learning, computational chemistry, and bioinorganic spectroscopy to explore the mechanisms of metalloenzymes. I have a diverse scientific background that includes general chemistry, biophysics, kinetics, and optics. My computational proficiency extends to a wide range of machine learning techniques, including deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. In addition, I possess hands-on experience with Git and cloud computing, and have gained extensive proficiency in various programming languages and platforms such as Python, C, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit Learn, Pandas, AWS, GCP, Azure, and Git.
