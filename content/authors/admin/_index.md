I am a fifth-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, seeking opportunities in the field as a Machine Learning Engineer, Applied Scientist, Research Scientist, or Data Scientist, with availability to start as early as August 2023.

My research focus is applying machine learning, computational chemistry, and bioinorganic spectroscopy to investigate mechanisms for metalloenzymes. I have gained proficiency in a wide range of machine learning techniques, including deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. Additionally, I have experience with Git and cloud computing, and have gained extensive experience using various programming languages and platforms such as Python, C, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit Learn, Pandas, AWS, GCP, Azure and Git.
